# MangaRec
A manga recommendation tool based on comparing various pieces of metadata collected from
manga series. The tool uses a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based
filtering to recommend manga series to users based on their preferences.

**Currently this project is a work in progress. The core entity API system is currently
forked from the [cbz-tagger](https://github.com/mjnitz02/cbz-tagger) API logic.**
